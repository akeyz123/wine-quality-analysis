Exploratory data analysis and machine learning models to predict wine quality
# 📊 Wine Quality Analysis & Prediction
# Overview
This project analyzes a wine quality dataset to understand how physicochemical properties influence wine ratings and to build machine learning models that predict wine quality.

# Problem Statement

Wine quality assessment depends on multiple chemical characteristics. The objective of this project is to explore these features, identify key influencing factors, and develop classification models capable of predicting wine quality scores.

# Dataset

* Wine Quality Dataset (Red Wine)
* Features include acidity levels, sugar content, pH, alcohol, sulphates
* Target variable: Wine quality score
